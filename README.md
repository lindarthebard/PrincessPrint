Meant to semi-sensibly print dictionaries and/or lists to arbitrary depths.

(Meant to work with Python 2.7, but probably works with Python3 and other versions.)

Pulled from another project after realising that this could be reused in the future and may be helpful for others to have available. Definitely needs work, especially considering it was yanked out of another project and only slightly generalised.

If you have any helpful suggestions or criticisms, I'd love to hear about them! Cheers!
