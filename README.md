Meant to semi-sensibly print dictionaries and/or lists to arbitrary depths.

Pulled from another project after realising that this could be reused in the future and may be helpful for others to have available. Definitely needs work, especially considering it was yanked out of another project and may still contain code specific to that use.

If you have any helpful suggestions or criticisms, I'd love to hear about them! Cheers!
